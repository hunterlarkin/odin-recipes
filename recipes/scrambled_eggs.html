    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Scrambled eggs are a simple and popular breakfast dish made by whisking eggs and 
        cooking them until they are softly set and slightly creamy. The eggs are beaten in 
        a bowl with a fork or whisk, seasoned with salt and pepper, and then cooked in a 
        pan with butter or oil over medium-low heat. As they cook, they are gently stirred 
        or folded to create fluffy, curds of cooked egg. Scrambled eggs can be enjoyed on 
        their own, paired with toast or a side of bacon, or used as a base for 
        various additions like cheese, vegetables, or herbs for additional flavor variations.
