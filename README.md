# Odin Recipes

This is a basic recipe website project for The Odin Project's HTML curriculum. The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate HTML skills.

In this project, you will build a simple recipe website consisting of a main index page with links to a few recipes. The focus is on structuring the content using HTML and creating a functional website rather than emphasizing visual design.

Future iterations of this project will involve styling the website with CSS.

By completing this project, you will demonstrate proficiency in HTML, including structuring web pages, creating links, and organizing content.

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. You can find more information and other projects at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
